Write a program that reads two positive integers D and i (in this order) from its input and adds the rest of the integers (all non-negative) in the input to a hash table of size D. Finally the program should output the content of the table. Use closed hashing with linear probing where the parameter is i and h(x)=x. The content of the table should be printed in the following format:
5
-1
7
8
...
where the output contains exactly D lines and an empty slot is printed as -1
